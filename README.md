# [Personal Website (WIP)](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wresen/)

- Welcome to my personal website repository! This website was built using Vite along with React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML. In addition, I used a special [Vite plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-singlefile?activeTab=readme) that allows serving a static website under a single HTML file for production. This plugin was necessary as my university servers only support the hosting of static websites. This means that if you download the website, you will be able to run the full web-app offline!

- Through this website, I aim to showcase my skills and provide insights into my experience and accomplishments. The website's design and functionality were carefully crafted to provide an efficient and engaging user experience.
